class Averager(optim.base.Optimizer):
    """Averaged stochastic gradient descent.

    This is a wrapper that can be applied to any stochastic gradient descent optimiser. Note that
    this implementation differs than what may be found elsewhere. Essentially, the average of the
    weights is usually only used at the end of the optimisation, once all the data has been seen.
    However, in this implementation the optimiser returns the current averaged weights.

    Parameters
    ----------
    optimizer
        An optimizer for which the produced weights will be averaged.
    start
        Indicates the number of iterations to wait before starting the average. Essentially,
        nothing happens differently before the number of iterations reaches this value.

    Examples
    --------

    >>> from river import datasets
    >>> from river import evaluate
    >>> from river import linear_model
    >>> from river import metrics
    >>> from river import optim
    >>> from river import preprocessing

    >>> dataset = datasets.Phishing()
    >>> optimizer = optim.Averager(optim.SGD(0.01), 100)
    >>> model = (
    ...     preprocessing.StandardScaler() |
    ...     linear_model.LogisticRegression(optimizer)
    ... )
    >>> metric = metrics.F1()

    >>> evaluate.progressive_val_score(dataset, model, metric)
    F1: 87.97%
