"""Model evaluation.

This module provides utilities to evaluate an online model. The goal is to reproduce a real-world
scenario with high fidelity. The core function of this module is `progressive_val_score`, which
allows to evaluate a model via progressive validation.

This module also exposes "tracks". A track is a predefined combination of a dataset and one or more
metrics. This allows a principled manner to compare models with each other. For instance,
the `RegressionTrack` contains several datasets and metrics to evaluate regression models. There is
also a bare `Track` class to implement a custom track. The `benchmarks` directory at the root of
the River repository uses these tracks.
