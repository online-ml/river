    """HyperLogLog algorithm for cardinality estimation.[^1][^2]

    The LogLog algorithm is designed to estimate cardinality of a data set with the aid
    of m bytes of auxiliary memory, known as registers.

    Firstly, each element in the data set is hashed into a binary string, ensuring data is
    uniformly distributed and simulating random distribution. The algorithm hashes each element
    into a binary string and then organizes these binary representations into registers.

    HyperLogLog, represents an improvement over the original LogLog algorithm by utilizing a
    technique called harmonic mean to estimate the cardinality.

    Parameters
    ----------
    b : int
        The precision parameter which determines the number of registers used (m = 2^b).
        Higher values of b provide more accurate estimates but use more memory.

    Attributes
    ----------
    m : int
        The number of registers (2^b).
    alpha : float
        A constant used in the cardinality estimation formula, which depends on m.
    registers : list of int
        A list of size m to store the maximum number of leading zeroes observed in the hash values.

    Methods
    -------
    update(x)
        Update the registers with the given element.
    count() -> int
        Estimate the number of distinct elements.
    __len__() -> int
        Return the estimated number of distinct elements.
    get_alpha(m) -> float
        Compute the bias correction constant alpha based on the number of registers.
    left_most_one(w) -> int
        Find the position of the left-most 1-bit in the binary representation of a number.


    Examples
    --------

    >>> from river import sketch

    >>> hyperloglog = sketch.HyperLogLog(b=15)

    >>> for i in range(100):
    ...     hyperloglog.update(i)

    >>> print(hyperloglog.count())
    100

    >>> hyperloglog = HyperLogLog(b=15)

    >>> for i in range(100):
    ...     hyperloglog.update(i%10)

    >>> print(hyperloglog.count())
    10
