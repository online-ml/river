class Grouper(base.Transformer):
    """Applies a transformer within different groups.

    This transformer allows you to split your data into groups and apply a transformer within each
    group. This happens in a streaming manner, which means that the groups are discovered online.
    A separate copy of the provided transformer is made whenever a new group appears. The groups
    are defined according to one or more keys.

    Parameters
    ----------
    transformer
    by
        The field on which to group the data. This can either by a single value, or a list of
        values.
