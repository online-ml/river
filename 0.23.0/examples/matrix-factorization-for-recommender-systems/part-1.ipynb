    "[Matrix Factorization (MF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_factorization_(recommender_systems)) is a class of [collaborative filtering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaborative_filtering) algorithms derived from [Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_value_decomposition). MF strength lies in its capacity to able to model high cardinality categorical variables interactions. This subfield boomed during the famous [Netflix Prize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix_Prize) contest in 2006, when numerous novel variants has been invented and became popular thanks to their attractive accuracy and scalability.\n",

    "MF approach seeks to fill the user-item matrix considering the problem as a [matrix completion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_completion) one. MF core idea assume a latent model learning its own representation of the users and the items in a lower latent dimensional space by factorizing the observed parts of the matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "A factorized user or item is represented as a vector $\\mathbf{v}_u$ or $\\mathbf{v}_i$ composed of $k$ latent factors, with $k << U, I$. Those learnt latent variables represent, for an item the various aspects describing it, and for a user its interests in terms of those aspects. The model then assume a user's choice or fondness is composed of a sum of preferences about the various aspects of the concerned item. This sum being the dot product between the latent vectors of a given user-item pair:\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "MF models weights are learnt in an online fashion, often with stochastic gradient descent as it provides relatively fast running time and good accuracy. There is a great and widely popular library named [surprise](http://surpriselib.com/) that implements MF models (and others) but in contrast with River doesn't follow a pure online philosophy (all the data have to be loaded in memory and the API doesn't allow you to update your model with new data).\n",

    "- In recent years, proposed deep learning techniques for recommendation tasks claim state of the art results. However, [recent work](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.06902) (August 2019) showed that those promises can't be taken for granted and traditional MF methods are still relevant today.\n",

    "- `n_factors`: the number of latent factors. The more you set, the more items aspects and users preferences you are going to learn. Too many will cause overfitting, `l2` regularization could help.\n",
    "- `*_optimizer`: the optimizers. Classic stochastic gradient descent performs well, finding the good learning rate will make the difference.\n",
