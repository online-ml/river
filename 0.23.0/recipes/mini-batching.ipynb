    "In its purest form, online machine learning encompasses models which learn with one sample at a time. This is the design which is used in River.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main downside of single-instance processing is that it doesn't scale to big data, at least not in the sense of traditional batch learning. Indeed, processing one sample at a time means that we are unable to fully take advantage of [vectorisation](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Vectorization) and other computational tools that are taken for granted in batch learning. On top of this, processing a large dataset in River essentially involves a Python `for` loop, which might be too slow for some usecases. However, this doesn't mean that River is slow. In fact, for processing a single instance, River is actually a couple of orders of magnitude faster than libraries such as scikit-learn, PyTorch, and Tensorflow. The reason why is because River is designed from the ground up to process a single instance, whereas the majority of other libraries choose to care about batches of data. Both approaches offer different compromises, and the best choice depends on your usecase.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to propose the best of both worlds, River offers some limited support for mini-batch learning. Some of River's estimators implement `*_many` methods on top of their `*_one` counterparts. For instance, `preprocessing.StandardScaler` has a `learn_many` method as well as a `transform_many` method, in addition to `learn_one` and `transform_one`. Each mini-batch method takes as input a `pandas.DataFrame`. Supervised estimators also take as input a `pandas.Series` of target values. We choose to use `pandas.DataFrames` over `numpy.ndarrays` because of the simple fact that the former allows us to name each feature. This in turn allows us to offer a uniform interface for both single instance and mini-batch learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, we will build a simple pipeline that scales the data and trains a logistic regression. Indeed, the `compose.Pipeline` class can be applied to mini-batches, as long as each step is able to do so."
