    "Active learning is a training regime, where the goal is to fit a model on the most discriminative samples. It is usually applied in situations where a limited amount of labeled data is available. In such a case, a human might be asked to annotate a sample. Doing this is expensive, so it's important to ask for labels for the most samples that will have the most impact.\n",
    "\n",
    "Online active learning is active learning done in a streaming fashion. Every time a prediction is made, an active learning strategy decides whether a label should be asked for or not. In case the strategy decides a yes, then the system could ask for a human to intervene. This is well summarized in the following schema from [Online Active Learning Methods for Fast Label-Efficient Spam Filtering](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=6fef6272cd72292e2f5a54d02d6e5352664e20cb)."
