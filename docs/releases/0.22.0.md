# 0.22.0 - 2024-11-23

- Dropped support for Python 3.9 and added support for Python 3.13.
- The methods `learn_one`, `learn_many`, `update`, `revert`, and `append` now return `None`.
- The units used in River have been corrected to be based on powers of 2 (KiB, MiB). This only changes the display, the behaviour is unchanged.

## cluster

- Update the description of `cluster.ODAC`.
- Change `draw` in `cluster.ODAC` to draw the hierarchical cluster's structure as a Graphviz graph.
- Add `render_ascii` in `cluster.ODAC` to render the hierarchical cluster's structure in text format.
- Work with `stats.Var` in `cluster.ODAC` when cluster has only one time series.

## drift

- Make `drift.ADWIN` comply with the reference MOA implementation.

## feature extraction

- The mini-batch methods for `feature_extraction.TFIDF` now systematically raise an exception, as they are not implemented.

## stats

- Removed the unexported class `stats.CentralMoments`.

## tree

- Instead of letting trees grow indefinitely, setting the `max_depth` parameter to `None` will stop the trees from growing when they reach the system recursion limit.
- Added `tree.LASTClassifier` (Local Adaptive Streaming Tree Classifier).

## stream

- `stream.iter_arff` now supports blank values (treated as missing values).
