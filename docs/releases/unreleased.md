# Unreleased

## neural_net

- Deprecated `river.neural_net`; importing it now emits a `DeprecationWarning` and users are encouraged to use `deep-river` for neural networks. Addresses [#1828](https://github.com/online-ml/river/issues/1828).

## tree

- Fixed `MondrianNodeClassifier.replant` not copying the `counts` attribute when promoting a leaf to a branch, leaving the new branch with `n_samples != 0` but empty class counts. The fix mirrors the regressor's `_mean` copy and matches the reference [`onelearn`](https://github.com/onelearn/onelearn) implementation. Addresses [#1823](https://github.com/online-ml/river/issues/1823).
- Fixed Mondrian tree leaf nodes losing their bounding box ranges during splits. Previously, when a leaf was split, the new child nodes did not inherit the `memory_range_min` and `memory_range_max` attributes, which caused incorrect range extension calculations. Fixes [#1801](https://github.com/online-ml/river/issues/1801)
- Fixed `MondrianNodeClassifier.replant` copying min and max bounds by reference instead of by value during a split. The fix ensures these arrays are explicitly copied by value so the bounds are correctly preserved. Fixed [#1834](https://github.com/online-ml/river/issues/1834)
