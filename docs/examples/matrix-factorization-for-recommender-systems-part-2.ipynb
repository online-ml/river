    "Steffen Rendel came up in 2010 with [Factorization Machines](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~b97053/paper/Rendle2010FM.pdf), an algorithm able to handle any real valued feature vector, combining the advantages of general predictors with factorization models. It became quite popular in the field of online advertising, notably after winning several Kaggle competitions. The modeling technique starts with a linear regression to capture the effects of each variable individually:\n",

    "\\hat{y}(x) = w_{0} + \\sum_{j=1}^{p} w_{j} x_{j}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Then are added interaction terms to learn features relations. Instead of learning a single and specific weight per interaction (as in [polynomial regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial_regression)), a set of latent factors is learnt per feature (as in MF). An interaction is calculated by multiplying involved features product with their latent vectors dot product. The degree of factorization — or model order — represents the maximum number of features per interaction considered. The model equation for a factorization machine of degree $d$ = 2 is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\normalsize\n",
    "\\hat{y}(x) = w_{0} + \\sum_{j=1}^{p} w_{j} x_{j}  + \\sum_{j=1}^{p} \\sum_{j'=j+1}^{p} \\langle \\mathbf{v}_j, \\mathbf{v}_{j'} \\rangle x_{j} x_{j'}\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\\normalsize\n",
    "\\langle \\mathbf{v}_j, \\mathbf{v}_{j'} \\rangle = \\sum_{f=1}^{k} \\mathbf{v}_{j, f} \\cdot \\mathbf{v}_{j', f}\n",

    "Higher-order FM will be covered in a following section, just note that factorization models express their power in sparse settings, which is also where higher-order interactions are hard to estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Strong emphasis must be placed on feature engineering as it allows FM to mimic most factorization models and significantly impact its performance. High cardinality categorical variables one hot encoding is the most frequent step before feeding the model with data. For more efficiency, `river` FM implementation considers string values as categorical variables and automatically one hot encode them. FM models have their own module [river.facto](https://online-ml.github.io/api/overview/#facto)."
