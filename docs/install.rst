Installation
============

``creme`` requires Python 3.6 or above. ``creme`` mostly relies on Python's standard library. However, it sometimes relies on ``numpy``, ``scipy``, and ``sklearn`` in order to avoid reinventing the wheel. ``creme`` can simply be installed using ``pip``.

    >>> pip install creme  # doctest: +SKIP

You can also install the latest development version as so:

    >>> pip install git+https://github.com/creme-ml/creme --upgrade  # doctest: +SKIP
