Please add a minimal example that we can reproduce the error by running the
code. Be as succinct as possible. In short, we
are going to copy-paste your code and we expect to get the same
result as you.

If we need to have access to a particular dataset to reproduce the error,
please attach it (or a reduced version if the file is too big) in a file (csv, json...).
If you are not allowed to share the dataset, please try to create a minimal example with synthetic
data which can allow us to reproduce the bug.

If the code is too long, feel free to put it in a public gist and link
it in the issue: https://gist.github.com
